Device::PiLite

This is a module to interface with the Pi-Lite device for the Raspberry
PI from Ciseco.  This is a self contained board based on the Lots of
Leds shield for the Arduino that supports the Raspberry PI by embedding
an Atmel AVR with (by default) firmware that allows the Raspberry PI to
communicate with it over the GPIO serial port.

This module simply encapsulates the required serial messages in order
to control the board.

INSTALLATION

It is assumed you have installed the board and followed the instructions
at:

http://openmicros.org/index.php/articles/94-ciseco-product-documentation/raspberry-pi/283-setting-up-my-raspberry-pi

to prepare your Raspberry PI to work with your board.  The instructions
are for the default Debian based OS, if you are using some other
distribution I'm assuming that you know enough to do the functional
equivalent. (For reference I developed this on a Fedora based
dsitribution.)

To install this module, run the following commands:

	perl Build.PL ./Build ./Build test ./Build install
